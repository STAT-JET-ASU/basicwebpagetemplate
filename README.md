# basicwebpagetemplate

This repository provides the skeleton for a basic web page compiled using the `rmarkdown` package's built-in site generator, as described in [Section 10.5](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html) of [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). It was created for a personal web page assingment for students enrolled in [STT3850 Data Science 1](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/DataScience1/) at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/).

The accompanying web page assignment can be found [here](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/DataScience1/Projects/Project00.html).
