Hello! Welcome to my site! Here you will find my resume, interstes, as well as a sample performance portfolio!

I am a mathematic major with a concrentration in business at Appalachian State University. While I love math, and all I can accomplish woth it, I have another passion as well. For 19 years, I have been training as a classical ballet dancer! After graduation, I hope to perform for a while before going back to school to persue my masters in mathematics!

I have loved ballet for as long as I can remember. Here is a link to my favorite performance by my favotite dancer, Marianela Nu√±ez.
