1.    Describe a situation where you had to work with someone who was difficult.  How was the person difficult, and how did you handle it?

	

2.     What are your job related values?

	I currently, and have on and off, for the past 4 years, managed a country club. I enjoy what I do, but I have found it difficult to be in charge of people my own age. Through this, Iâ€™ve realized a few things. 
	At the forefront, a positive attitude can do wonders for a team of people. Negativity spreads quickly. This can be put to ease by encouraging positivity and a healthy work environment. 
	Additionally, there is one other idea that comes to mind. As a manager, I try never to ask anyone to do something that I can already do. I believe it is easy to get a little lazy, especially when in charge of large numbers of people. This can force a sense of solidarity and teamwork, which makes working a little easier. 


3.                    Tell me about a time when you had too many things to do and you were required to prioritize your tasks.

In a recent semester, I tried prioritizing work over school. I was regularly working 50 hours a week, along with 18 hours of class. Needless to say, it did not go well. I had gotten the idea into my head that I needed to maintain my responsibilities at work in order to ease financial burden during school. This was entirely counterintuitive, as I was not doing well in school, as a result of this. Instead of finding a healthy balance between work, school, and life, I put everything I had into work. 
I ended up not doing well the entire semester, but I learned a very valuable lesson. For me personally, I need balance, in order to prioritize. It took an entire semester, but I figured things out the hard way. By experiencing failure, I was able to learn more about myself and about how I need to operate in order to succeed in a healthy way.
